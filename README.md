# Error Handling for Users

Handling errors is useful as it allows us to stop errors from crashing our server. When we start out it's useful to console log these errors to see what happened, but this isn't very useful for the users of our site. In this workshop we are going to learn how to avoid errors with validation, handle the remaining errors safely and then safely deliver them to the front end so users can see what happened. 

## Prerequisits
Knowledge of:
- sql databases
- express node server
- handlebars
- promises

## Get Up and running

1. Clone or fork the repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ameliejyc/phent-boilerplate.git
```

2. Install all the dependencies by cd-ing into the folder and running:

```
$ npm i
```

3. Start the server:

```
$ npm run dev
```

4. Navigate to to http://localhost:3000/ to view the page. 

## Where do our errors go?
It's easy to think of error handling on the server in isolation to the rest of our site, after all we're often forced to do it because of the error first callback nature of Node. However, the way we decide to handle errors is an architectural decision which impacts how we write code on the front and back end of our apps.

Let's break down why this is important:

> why do catch errors on our server? 

To stop our server from crashing 🙌🏽

> why don't we want our server to crash?
 
because our website will stop responding 🙌🏽

> why is this bad?
 
because our users won't be able to use our site 🙌🏽

> what happens if the only way we handle our error is to console log, will our users know what went wrong?
 
Ummmmmmm.... 🤔

The answer is _nope_, if we don't send relevant responses to our client AND handle these appropriately, then our site can appear to hang/break/not respond as a user would expect.

We build web apps for users, so in this workshop we're going to take a user centered approach to error handling.

To model this approach we are going to edit a simple site that has a form to allows users to sign up by entering their name, username, and password. We are going to break our user centered error handling into 3 parts:
- informing our users of errors
- validating data on the frontend
- handling errors on our server _to inform our users_

## Displaying error messages
Displaying errors on your website allows users to know what went wrong. This might be because:
- their input is invalid
- the action they have attempted did not work

If you go to `views/index.hbs` you can see the form that has been created for users to input information. Each input is followed by an error icon that is `hidden` by default. There is also an error paragraph at the bottom of the form that is `hidden`.

In `main.js` an event listener has been added to the "First Name" input box. Front end validation is being used to check if this contains no numbers and special characters on `blur`.

_NB: did you know on `blur` is an event type for when elements go out of focus. You can find out more about [different event types in MDNs docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)_

Go to localhost:3000 and test the "Full Name" input box to see how this works
### Challenge One
Using the starting code as an example, create error messages for the other 3 input boxes.

## Front End Validation
Validation is useful as it allows us to check that the correct data types are being submitted to our server. So far we are displaying errors to tell users if any information that have entered in invalid, however they are still able to submit the form.

### Challenge Two
Overwrite the submit button on the form so that you can handle when the data is submitted. Only allow users to submit the information if is passes your validation checks.

If you are comfortable with promises, you can you `fetch` to make a call to your server.

[Check out MDNs docs on making a POST request with fetch here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch).

You will need to grab the data inputted in your form and create a stringified JSON object to send as the body.

## Back End Validation
Now that we have written validation for the front end, we can implement this on the server too. This is important as users can still bypass our front end validation to submit the form by either disabling the javascript file, or using a tool like postman.


### Challenge Three
**Step 1.**
In the handler grab the form data from the request and use the same validation checks from the front end on the form route.

**Step 2.**
If any part of the data does not pass validation checks send an error response to the front end. It is useful if you send your data in an object like this:
```
{
  error: true,
  message: _what the error is_
}
```

Remember to also [set your status code](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.status) to one that describes the response.

[A list of status codes can be found here](https://httpstatuses.com/).
[Or if you prefer a more visual explanation, here's status codes as cats](https://http.cat/).

Now on the front end you can check the status code of your response and set the error p tag correctly.

## Back End Error handling
Now we can check if the user already exists in our database.

Set up your database
___
 In terminal type psql, or pgcli if installed. Within psql/pcli enter the
following commands each followed by a return. Things in square brackets are for
your desired values. Note that password is a string inside '' (NOT double quotes
-> ""):

```
CREATE DATABASE [db_name];
CREATE USER [user_name] WITH SUPERUSER PASSWORD ['password'];
ALTER DATABASE [db_name] OWNER TO [user_name];
```

Create a `.env` file in your root directory and add your database url:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://[user_name]:[password]@localhost:5432/[db_name]
```

Next open psql/pgcli in terminal and connect to your test database: `\c [test_database_name]`

Then build your database `\i [full_path_to_db_build.sql]` 
(To easily copy a file's full path right click on it in your editor and click on "Copy Full Path")
___

### Challenge Four
Now that we have a database of users, we can check if our user exists in our form handler.

**Step 1.**
Use your validated username and pass it to the `checkUser` database query. You can see how the query is written in `/database/queries/check_user`
If the user exists `rows` will be:
```
[ { exists: true } ]
```
If the user doesn't exist `rows` will be:
```
[ { exists: false } ]
```
Write an if/else statement to take `rows.exists`. If the user already exists return an appropriate [status code](https://http.cat/) and error message to the frontend. We can use the same format as before:
```
{
  error: true,
  message: _what the error is_
}
```
You will need to write logic in the return to your `fetch` to display the error message if 

If the user doesn't exists we want to return a `200` status code to tell the front end everything went well. Then we can redirect to `/success` in the response of your fetch using the window object:
```
window.location = '/success';
```
More details on [`window.location` can be found in MDN's docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/location).

**Step 2.**
Now we need to handle our error if there is a problem with the database. In `routes/form.js` add a `.catch` to our database query.

In here we want to send another error object to the front end with an appropriate [status code](https://http.cat/).

Now we can display the correct error message on the front end!

## Nice WORK

Congratulations, ✨ YOU DID IT ✨ You've safely avoided errors with validation, and handles the ones that slipped through by sending clear error messages for your users to see
